This was a project for EE445 to pratice machine learning techniques. We were split into groups to collaborate on writing code in python using different machine learning methods. The competition provided clinical data on patients with different progressions of Parkinson's disease. In machine learning, lasso is a regression analysis method that performs both variable selection and regularization in order to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability.
