<p>The printf() function in the C programming language serves as a powerful tool for formatting and displaying strings, employing a format string as its first argument to dictate the desired output structure. This format string contains placeholders denoted by the ‘%’ character, serving as positions where the printf() function inserts corresponding data during the printing process. While widely used for its flexibility, format strings can become potential sources of vulnerability if not handled with caution. It’s crucial to recognize that the vulnerability associated with format strings extends beyond the printf() function to other functions like sprintf(), fprintf(), and scanf().</p>

<p>In this particular lab, students are tasked with gaining hands-on experience in understanding and exploiting format string vulnerabilities. The focal point is a program deliberately designed with a format string vulnerability. The overarching objective for students is to leverage their knowledge acquired in class to exploit this vulnerability systematically, achieving a series of progressively impactful outcomes.</p>

<p>The first challenge involves crashing the program intentionally, demonstrating the susceptibility of the system to external manipulation. Subsequently, students delve into more sophisticated exploits, attempting to read the internal memory of the program, thereby breaching its data integrity. Building on this foundation, the task extends to modifying the internal memory of the program, showcasing the potential for unauthorized alterations.</p>

<p>The pinnacle of the exercise lies in the most severe scenario, where students are challenged to inject and execute malicious code utilizing the victim program’s privileges. This phase underscores the critical importance of input validation and sanitization in programs that handle format strings. Failure to adequately safeguard against such vulnerabilities can open avenues for attackers to manipulate code execution, posing significant security risks.</p>

<p>By engaging in this practical exploration, students not only reinforce their theoretical understanding of format string vulnerabilities but also develop a heightened awareness of the real-world implications of insecure coding practices. The lab thus provides a valuable opportunity for hands-on learning in a controlled environment, fostering a deeper appreciation for the importance of secure coding practices in the realm of software development and cybersecurity.</p>
