*My Thoughts on JavaScript*

As someone who has never used Javascript before, I like the diverse use cases for using this coding language. The similarities between Javascript and other coding languages that I have used, such as python and C, is the syntax for loops and use of recursion functions. I learned a lot about this language through assignment E07 and got to experience some of the differences between this language and the other languages I used before. I think Javascript is a good programming language because it can be used for different applications such as web design and program design. 

I personally like the idea of athletic software engineering. The practice WODâ€™s are useful because experience is one the best ways to learn and improve in programming. This style of learning will force you to use the programming language more often than independent use, which is helpful for me personally. This style of learning can also be stressful as you must learn to manage your time to be able to code constantly regardless of schedule. I do find this style also enjoyable by providing more experience in coding. I think this style will work better for me than independently studying on my own.
