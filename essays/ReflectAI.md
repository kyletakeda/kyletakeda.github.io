## I. Introduction
The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education has revolutionized the way we approach learning, especially in fields like Software Engineering. In ICS 314, the utilization of AI tools and methodologies has become integral to the educational experience. This essay reflects on my personal experiences with AI in ICS 314, exploring how AI has influenced my learning, understanding, and application of software engineering principles. The AI tools mentioned include ChatGPT, Bard, and Co-Pilot.

## II. Personal Experience with AI
Experience WODs e.g. E18: Depending on the WOD I will use AI to try to find errors or reason for errors.
In-class Practice WODs: I try not to use AI for the practice WODs to try and improve my skills.
In-class WODs: I will use AI for In-class WODs if I am stuck on the problem.
Essays: I will use AI for essays to give ideas for writing.
Final project: I have not used AI for the final project yet, but if I encounter a problem I might try to solve it using AI.
Learning a concept / tutorial: I usually do not use AI for learning a new concept as I don't retain knowledge the best this way.
Answering a question in class or in Discord: I never use AI for questions but maybe I should start seeing what questions it can come up with.
Asking or answering a smart-question: I don't use AI for asking or answering smart-questions as I try to use my own knowledge for this.
Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”: I have used AI for providing coding examples as it is a quick way to learn how to use a piece of code.
Explaining code: I usually don't need AI to exlain code as there are plenty of resources online that do it.
Writing code: I will use AI to write code depending if I can independently write it myself or not.
Documenting code: I will use AI to document code as it makes it easier to understand.
Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here>”: I have used AI for this sometimes to make code run and look better.
Other uses in ICS 314 not listed: I can't think of any.

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding
The incorporation of AI has significantly influenced my learning experience in ICS 314. AI accelerated routine tasks, allowing more time for in-depth exploration of complex concepts. However, the importance of personal understanding remained paramount. AI served as a complementary tool, reinforcing concepts and providing alternative perspectives.

## IV. Practical Applications
Beyond ICS 314, AI found practical applications in collaborative projects and real-world simulations, such as the HACC. AI's effectiveness was evident in automating repetitive tasks, allowing teams to focus on higher-level problem-solving and innovation.

## V. Challenges and Opportunities
Challenges in using AI included the need for careful validation of generated content and the risk of over-reliance. Opportunities lie in leveraging AI for routine tasks, freeing up cognitive resources for more creative and complex problem-solving.

## VI. Comparative Analysis
Comparatively, traditional teaching methods foster deeper engagement and understanding. While AI expedites certain aspects, the blend of traditional teaching and AI-enhanced approaches seems optimal for comprehensive learning, addressing diverse learning styles.

## VII. Future Considerations
The future role of AI in software engineering education should involve refining AI tools to better understand contextual nuances, fostering more interactive and adaptive learning experiences. Emphasizing a balanced approach that integrates AI as a supportive tool rather than a replacement is crucial.

## VIII. Conclusion
In conclusion, AI has played a vital role in shaping my learning experience in ICS 314. While AI tools expedited certain tasks, their true value lies in their ability to complement human understanding. The future integration of AI in software engineering education should focus on striking a balance, harnessing the strengths of both AI and traditional teaching methods for a more enriching educational experience.
