## Project Name: UH Store
group: Kyle and Mark

## Overview
The problem: Finding UH Manoa clothing for fans and students can be difficult to find. You have to use website, which is hard to navigate, or go to student store that has low inventory.

The solution: Create an app or website that is more specific to clothing and it easier to use for people not familiar with technology.

## Approach
The app has three user roles, all of whom login with their UH ID or created user login. Regular users browse the inventory. App admins have the ability to edit and update the inventory.
The site will have categories and filters to help sort through items of interest. Search function will be included to help find specific items.
Admins have control to site to update inventory and let users know what is in stock and future releases.
Some possible mockup pages include:

Landing page
Home page
Admin home page
Mens clothing page
Womens clothing page
kids clothing page

## Use Cast Ideas
New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile.
Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site.
User goes to landing page, logs in, looks for items of interest.
Admin goes into site, updates inventory.

## Beyond the basics
After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:

Include maps/location for where you find items if not found in store.
Add suggestion feature to help find items they may be interested in.
